# Flight-Reservation-System

The program is a flight reservation system that allows users to reserve and cancel seats on a plane. It uses a ragged array to represent the seats on the plane and a file to store passenger data. The program offers a menu of operations that include reading the passenger data from the file, reserving a seat, canceling a reserved seat, canceling all reserved seats, updating the passenger file, printing a map of the plane's seats, and quitting the program. The program handles errors and exceptions and validates user input.

Operations:

  1- ReadPassengersFile : Reads passenger data (seat number : reserve name) from the file and updates the seats array accordingly.
  
  2- ReserveSeat : Allows the user to reserve a seat by providing the seat number and passenger name.
  
  3- DeleteReservedSeat : Allows the user to delete a reserved seat by providing the seat number.
  
  4- DeleteAllReserves : Deletes all reserved seats in the seats array.
  
  5- UpdatePassengersFile : Writes the reserved seats data from the seats array to the passengers file.
  
  6- PrintMapOfPlane : Prints the flight seats map showing the status of each seat (reserved or empty).
  
  7- Exit : Ends the program and closes any open resources.
